   ** Warning ** Site:GroundTemperature:BuildingSurface: Some values fall outside the range of 15-25C.
   **   ~~~   ** These values may be inappropriate.  Please consult the Input Output Reference for more details.
   ** Warning ** ProcessScheduleInput: Schedule:Constant="ALWAYS OFF DISCRETE", Blank Schedule Type Limits Name input -- will not be validated.
   ** Warning ** ProcessScheduleInput: Schedule:Constant="ALWAYS ON CONTINUOUS", Blank Schedule Type Limits Name input -- will not be validated.
   ** Warning ** GetSurfaceData: WindowProperty:ShadingControl: "SHADING CONTROL 1" is not referenced by any window.
   ** Warning ** CheckUsedConstructions: There are 26 nominally unused constructions in input.
   **   ~~~   ** For explicit details on each unused construction, use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings;
   ** Warning ** Output:Meter: invalid Key Name="DISTRICTCOOLING:FACILITY" - not found.
   ** Warning ** Output:Meter: invalid Key Name="DISTRICTHEATING:FACILITY" - not found.
   ** Warning ** Output:Meter:MeterFileOnly requested for "Electricity:Facility" (TimeStep), already on "Output:Meter". Will report to both eplusout.eso and eplusout.mtr

   ** Warning ** The resource referenced by LifeCycleCost:UsePriceEscalation= "U.S. AVG  COMMERCIAL-ELECTRICITY" has no energy cost. 
   **   ~~~   ** ... It is likely that the wrong resource is used. The resource should match the meter used in Utility:Tariff.
   ** Warning ** The resource referenced by LifeCycleCost:UsePriceEscalation= "U.S. AVG  COMMERCIAL-DISTILLATE OIL" has no energy cost. 
   **   ~~~   ** ... It is likely that the wrong resource is used. The resource should match the meter used in Utility:Tariff.
   ** Warning ** The resource referenced by LifeCycleCost:UsePriceEscalation= "U.S. AVG  COMMERCIAL-RESIDUAL OIL" has no energy cost. 
   **   ~~~   ** ... It is likely that the wrong resource is used. The resource should match the meter used in Utility:Tariff.
   ** Warning ** The resource referenced by LifeCycleCost:UsePriceEscalation= "U.S. AVG  COMMERCIAL-NATURAL GAS" has no energy cost. 
   **   ~~~   ** ... It is likely that the wrong resource is used. The resource should match the meter used in Utility:Tariff.
   ** Warning ** The resource referenced by LifeCycleCost:UsePriceEscalation= "U.S. AVG  COMMERCIAL-COAL" has no energy cost. 
   **   ~~~   ** ... It is likely that the wrong resource is used. The resource should match the meter used in Utility:Tariff.
   ************* Simulation Error Summary *************
   ************* There are 13 unused schedules in input.
   ************* There are 20 unused week schedules in input.
   ************* There are 50 unused day schedules in input.
   ************* Use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayUnusedSchedules; to see them.

   ************* ===== Final Error Summary =====
   ************* The following error categories occurred.  Consider correcting or noting.
   ************* Nominally Unused Constructions
   ************* ..The nominally unused constructions warning is provided to alert you to potential conditions that can cause
   ************* ..extra time during simulation. Each construction is calculated by the algorithm indicated in the HeatBalanceAlgorithm
   ************* ..object. You may remove the constructions indicated (when you use the DisplayExtraWarnings option).
